@0806 checking the database, it seems as though my implementation for the tags did actually work! must doubly confirm, of course - but the posts and corresponding tags are present. even better, only the two tags exists, with multiple duplicate posts, meaning the code works thoroughly as intended.

@1027 Post Model Schema to be created next, along
      with middleware to parse text. Pretty much
      would like to make sure new lines are kept
      and that bold and italics can be used 

      postRoutes should be createPost, getPost.
      delete and editPost as well. editPost should
      return text to the user facing form (using 
      front end code)
