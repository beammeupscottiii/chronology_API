@2141 currently having issues with the JWT signing. the returned JWT doesnt include the values I signed it with. may be an issue in how I am implementing it. will check some tutorial or the docs again

@1027 Post Model Schema to be created next, along
      with middleware to parse text. Pretty much
      would like to make sure new lines are kept
      and that bold and italics can be used 

      postRoutes should be createPost, getPost.
      delete and editPost as well. editPost should
      return text to the user facing form (using 
      front end code)
